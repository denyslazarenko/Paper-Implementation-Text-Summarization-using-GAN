1. How we should connect our presentation with my partner? Should I add code snippet which  I wrote myself? 
2. How do you find the context of the presentation?
3. How should my code look like at the end? Now it compiles, but I cannot present any end-resultes, due to the fact that I dont have enough power for training. (Jupyter notebook with the components where I show what particular part does?)
